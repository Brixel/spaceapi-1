openlab-aux spaceapi implementation
===================================

SpaceAPI implementation as used for the openlab-augsburg. To keep the ```open``` value up-to-date, you can either call spacecgi manually or tell your router to update it periodically deploying it to your router and adding it as a cronjob.

Additionally, ```image.py``` delivers either the open or the closed image, depending on the status of the closed field in ```data.json```. We included that on our wiki frontpage.
